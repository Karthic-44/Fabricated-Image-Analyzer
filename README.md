# Fabricated Image Analyzer

Images are often manipulated with the intent and purpose of benefiting one party. In fact, images are often considered as evidence of a fact or reality, therefore, fake news or any form of publication that uses images that have been manipulated in such a way has greater capability and potential to mislead. 

To detect image forgeries, large amounts of image data are needed, and a model that can process every pixel in the image. Apart from that, efficiency and flexibility in training data are also needed to support its use in everyday life. The concept of big data and deep learning is the right solution to this problem. Therefore, with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that utilizes Error Level Analysis (ELA), image forgery detection can reach 91.83% and convergence in only 9 epochs. This project uses deep learning to classify images as original images and images that have undergone modifications with a simpler architecture, so that computational costs can be reduced. Involving the use of ELA in machine learning as an effort to increase efficiency.
